  <p>
  Skins, stickers, and charms are integral elements of gaming that offer players a fun and creative way 
  to express their individuality and personalize their gameplay experience. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Skins are perhaps the most recognizable, providing a visual overhaul for weapons or equipment. 
  From intricate designs and bold colors to themes that reflect a specific mood, event, or fandom, skins can turn standard gear into a masterpiece. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Stickers, on the other hand, allow players to decorate their items 
  further with smaller, often symbolic or humorous designs. Whether it’s a tribute to a favorite team, a clever slogan, or a flashy emblem, 
  stickers add a unique touch and showcase a player’s personal taste or achievements.
  </p>
  <p>
  Charms bring a dynamic and interactive element to customization. These small trinkets hang from weapons, 
  often moving as you play, adding a sense of character and attention to detail. Together, skins, stickers, 
  and charms not only enhance the visual appeal of your loadout but also create a deeper connection between 
  you and the tools you use in the game, making every moment in the game feel more personal and rewarding.

          Skins, also referred to as finishes, introduced in the Arms Deal update.
          They are weapons with different textures that can be equipped in-game. 
          They are entirely cosmetic, holding no gameplay function.
        </p>
        <p><b>
          To acquire a skin, one must either:
        </b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Earn them through random drops by playing in online community and official servers.</li>
          <li>From opening containers, such as weapon cases or souvenir packages.</li>
          <li>Trade 10 skins of the same rarity for one of a higher rarity with a Trade Up Contract.</li>
          <li>Buying skins from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Market</a>.</li>

          <p><b>Stickers</b> were introduced in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with the February 5, 
          2014 update and are purely cosmetic addition to customize a player's weapon.</p>
        <p>A sticker from the player's inventory can be applied only once to any gun or gun skin owned, 
            after which it will be removed from the player's inventory and only exist on the weapon it was placed onto.
            Trading the weapon skin will carry the applied stickers with them, though stickers applied to vanilla skins (stock weapon skins) 
            cannot be traded since vanilla weapon skins cannot be traded.
            A maximum of 5 stickers can be applied to a weapon.</p>
        <p><b>Stickers can be acquired by:</b></p>
