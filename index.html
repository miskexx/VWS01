<h2 style="color: #984042;text-align: center;">GUN SKINS</h2>
<p>Skins, also referred to as finishes, introduced in the Arms Deal update.
   They are weapons with different textures that can be equipped in-game. 
   They are entirely cosmetic, holding no gameplay function.</p>
<p><b>To acquire a skin, one must either:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Earn them through random drops by playing in online community and official servers.</li>
  <li>From opening containers, such as weapon cases or souvenir packages.</li>
  <li>Trade 10 skins of the same rarity for one of a higher rarity with a Trade Up Contract.</li>
  <li>Buying skins from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Market</a>.</li>
  <li>Trading with other players.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color: #984042; text-align: center;">STICKERS</h2>
<p><b>Stickers</b> were introduced in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with the February 5, 
  2014 update and are purely cosmetic addition to customize a player's weapon.</p>
<p>A sticker from the player's inventory can be applied only once to any gun or gun skin owned, 
    after which it will be removed from the player's inventory and only exist on the weapon it was placed onto.
    Trading the weapon skin will carry the applied stickers with them, though stickers applied to vanilla skins (stock weapon skins) 
    cannot be traded since vanilla weapon skins cannot be traded.
    A maximum of 5 stickers can be applied to a weapon.</p>
<p><b>Stickers can be acquired by:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Opening a Sticker Capsule</li>
    <li>Buying them from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Market</a>.</li>
    <li>Trading with other players</li>
    <li>Finding them pre-applied on skins on the Steam Market</li>
  </ol>

    <h2 style="color: #984042; text-align: center;">CHARMS</h2>
<p>On October 2nd, 2024, CS2 introduced a new Armory Update that brought two brand-new charm collections: 
    the Missing Link Charm Collection and the Small Arms Charm Collection. These charms are an exciting addition to the game, 
    providing players with stylish, attachable collectibles that can be displayed on their weapons.</p>
    <p><b>Charms can be acquired by:</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Buying them from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Market</a>.</li>
    <li>Trading with other players</li>
