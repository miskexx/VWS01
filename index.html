    However, if someone has stumbled onto our website and has no idea what we’re talking about, let us explain.

  <p>
    Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation which is a part of the Counter-Strike series. 
    It was announced to the public on March 22, 2023 with an tentative full release for Summer 2023 and a limited test beginning the same day. 
    It was officially released on September 27, 2023. This is the first game of the Counter-Strike series which utilizes Valve's
    Source 2 game engine and features major technological advancements since Global Offensive such as "sub-tick" net-code technology, 
    new voxel based volumetric smokes, and a new toolset for developing maps.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game was generally positively received by critics. Player response to the game was however,
    mixed, primarily as a result of removed content (e.g. Danger Zone) and features that CS:GO had, CS:GO being delisted on the store,
    and the game being incompatible with older PCs and macOS, or having performance and other technical issues. 
    The Metacritic user reviews were later review bombed, alongside with Steam, which caused the recent reviews to briefly drop to "Mixed".
  </p>
  <h3>
   New features introduced in Counter-Strike 2 including:
  </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
       <b>Volumetric smokes</b> - Smokes are now volumetric objects that can be pushed by grenades, 
        bullets, and more. It also reacts to lighting and the smokes fill the spaces naturally.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Sub-tick system</b> - Tick rate no longer matters for moving, shooting, or throwing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Improved Steam Audio</b> - Sounds have been reworked to better reflect the physical environment, 
        be more distinct, and express more game state. They have also been rebalanced for a more comfortable listening experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hardware accelerated ray-tracing for VRAD</b> - VRAD3 now requires graphics card (NVIDIA RTX, AMD RX series) 
        with ray-tracing support to preview & bake lighting. This will allow VRAD to quickly calculates lighting data. 
        VRAD3 was also available on older Source 2 games.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CMAA anti-aliasing</b> - Replacement for FXAA. Another post-processing anti-aliasing method which was sharper than FXAA. 
        Unlike FXAA, CMAA in Counter-Strike 2 cannot be used alongside MSAA. 
      </li>
    </ul>

        <td>The classic game mode: Two teams of 5 players fight in a best of 24 rounds. 
          In Bomb Defusal scenarios, Terrorists must plant a bomb at a target and defend it until it explodes
          - Counter-Terrorists must either stop them from planting or defuse the bomb before it detonates. 
          In Hostage Rescue scenarios, Counter-Terrorists must find and escort a hostage - Terrorists must stop them. 
          There are skill groups for ranked matchmaking so that ideally players are matched with enemies of a similar skill level. 
          In unranked matchmaking, these skill groups are also regarded but not adjusted.</td>

        with whatever weapon they wish to use. Weapons are free and only rifles, SMGs, heavy weapons, pistols and the Zeus x27 may be bought. Players have 
        a short invulnerability period to buy weapons before moving.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Arms Race</td>
        <td>5-10 minutes</td>

        All players start with the same weapon and get a new one each time they kill an enemy. 
        The progression of unlocked weapons ends with the knife. The first player to get two kills with every 
        weapon plus a kill with the golden knife wins the match.</td>
